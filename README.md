 The WhatsApp Revolution Is Happening, and It’s Real

 My Testimony – From “Who dey help?” to “Please, how much to post on your status?”

Let me be real. In 2023, my barbing salon was bleeding customers. I was posting flyers in groups and begging people like “abeg repost”. But the engagement? Zero. Then one of my customers, Chuks, whispered: “Guy, check 7hubent Tech. E go change your business.”

Na so I enter.

I joined one of their WhatsApp groups, dropped my business ad, and by the next day—no jokes—people were calling from Lekki, Surulere, even Abuja. Someone said, “I saw your ad on 7hubent, you mobile?” Bro, that day, I knew: this 7hubent no be regular.

By the end of that month, I was making so much I started charging other businesses to post on my own WhatsApp status. Just imagine!
